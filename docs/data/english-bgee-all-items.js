In some circles known as Narbucchad's Fickle Finger, this weapon represents the culmination of his reign. Driven by paranoia and mistrust, Narbucchad successively eliminated his guard in fear of attempts at assassination , and channeled all of his magic into a weapon after his own that could strike down any foe or number of would-be assailants at a time. Originally devised for such dire circumstances only, he quickly grew fond of its potential to cut all sorts of quarrels short and before long came to rely upon it wholly.\n\nHowever, the staff required frequent recharging as its enchantments, albeit powerful, would quickly drain in frequent use and spring the orb of power from its socket, requiring careful reinsertion. Many stories circulated of those who had survived and escaped by whim of his Fickle Finger and thus known, it happened to fail him at rather a crucial moment before long.\n\nBoth the staff and his reign were eventually lost to the annals of history, the former in absence of his spells reduced to an elaborate bauble. How it ended up here is anyone's guess.

A Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success.

A Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success.
