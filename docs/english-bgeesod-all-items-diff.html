"Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow,
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth,
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

"The Duke of Everlund known for his boast 
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear. 
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year. 

"One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree 
A bow's shot death in its heart was found. 

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke,
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

"The evil lord demanded justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

"In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"Again called the forest with its precious game,
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek. 
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon 
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

"Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir,
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird 
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

"The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end,
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance;
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut,
But first flew Adaniss's axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off,
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open.

Rule Five: A mage is only as good as their robe. Though you may never rival my exquisite collection of Faerûn's finest robes (may? I am too humble. None could rival that collection of finery), you would do well to obtain a quality tailor at the first opportunity.

It was with no little joy that I received your missive. Corresponding with those who have read my books and learning how my advice has positively affected their lives is a source of great pleasure for me. That you were able to write such a letter without the use of your arms makes the feat even more impressive—I suspect in the future you will take my oft-repeated mantra "Do not wrestle an angry ogre, or indeed any ogre, if it can be avoided" to heart.

I gather from your note that you found my words less useful than one might have hoped when it came to the matter of the ogre wrestling. I have some questions regarding the events that led to such an unfortunate happenstance:

1) How did you come to find yourself in amongst a pack of savage, bloodthirsty ogres? Over the years, I have offered many suggestions and strategies designed to help the prudent adventurer avoid just such a situation as this. If nothing else, my advice regarding the fortifying of one's home and the frequency with which one leaves it (my advice being "never"), if followed, should have prevented such a circumstance as this from ever occurring.

2) Who challenged whom to the wrestling match? I do hope that it was the ogre's idea, as I'm quite certain the flaws in such a scheme originating from your side of the equation have become painfully self-evident.

3) Had you ever considered a profession that carries with it slightly less risk of having one's arms torn off by a redblooding great ogre? Those who aren't cut out for adventure will often find themselves torn from it if they fail to act with the appropriate level of caution. Though they lack the potential glory a lucky few are able to wrest from a life of exploration and action, there is no shame whatsoever in fulfilling the role of a farmer, a courtesan, a tailor, or any number of other, more banal occupations. Someone has to shine my boots, after all.

However you came to this regrettable state, I hope you will take some solace in the enclosed copy of my latest book. As you are a reader of my work, I have signed the volume and shall have the messenger take ten percent off the price I generally charge. May you find some enlightenment or entertainment in its pages during your period of convalescence.

Yours very truly,

Finally, one night Tinny stabbed his mark in a mugging gone wrong and was shocked to see a gem fall out of the victim's wound. Tinny eagerly grabbed the gem, rejoicing in his newfound wealth. Stories of Tinny's good fortune spread quickly. A few days later, he was found stabbed to death in his bed, his dagger gone.

"Dearest Karella,

Our journey to the Shadow King's outpost has been long and treacherous. Trolls, hobgoblins, gnolls, xvarts, and even a gargoyle stood 'twixt us and our goal, but we have finally made it across Coast Way Crossing. If the map purloined from the Netherese vampire steers us true, we cannot be far from our goal.

Even if this venture proves as profitable as Walkins believes it will be (I'll believe that when I see it and perhaps not even then), there are many more dangers ahead. No property of the Shadow King will be left undefended. At a minimum, we are told to expect resistance from a small army of minor undead, which do not concern me overmuch, and a lich under the influence of the King's Overmind, which concerns me greatly.

Once these threats are dealt with, the going should become much easier. Along with the map, the vampire 'supplied' us with a key it claimed opens the door to the Shadow King's Inner Sanctum. It spoke of a treasure room hidden within, loaded with items of great power and value.

I send this letter to you in the hopes that it finds you in good health and that we will be together again soon—but however soon that may be, it cannot be soon enough for my taste. Until then, I remain yours,

At a minimum, we are told to expect resistance from a small army of minor undead, which do not concern me overmuch, and a lich under the influence of the King's Overmind, which concerns me greatly.

Once these threats are dealt with, the going should become much easier. Along with the map, the vampire 'supplied' us with a key it claimed opens the door to the Shadow King's Inner Sanctum. It spoke of a treasure room hidden within, loaded with items of great power and value.

I send this letter to you in the hopes that it finds you in good health and that we will be together again soon—but however soon that may be, it cannot be soon enough for my taste. Until then, I remain yours,

Agda Coldhearth"

The Shining Lady
The shining hair and glowing eyes of our great leader, Caelar Argent, tell a tale of the divine; she is the last and greatest member of a line birthed of gods and a family of paladins. For generations, the Argents served as noble knights of Lathander.

Caelar believed she too would join the ranks of the Order of the Aster. But her vision was too vast for the Order’s limited faith. Her demands to take unflinching action against the forces of evil fell on deafened ears. Caelar left the knighthood, seeking a means by which to fulfill her righteous vision.

(Scrawled notation: No mention of her transgression or its abominable repercussions. Records must exist in Waterdeep. When you receive these notes, seek out the Order’s chapterhouse and see what you can find.)

An Auspicious Meeting
Caelar wandered the world alone, learning all she could of the evils that threatened it. The knowledge she gained filled her with anguish. Hers was a vision of glory, but how could she bring that glory to a dark world doing naught but growing darker?

Her doubts took her to a bridge overlooking the Winding Way. She looked into the dark waters flowing below and questioned all she had once believed to be true. Perhaps she was wrong. Perhaps she had not been chosen to rid the world of evil.

It was in this, her greatest moment of doubt, that Brother Hephernaan appeared. Seeing in him a good and gentle soul, Caelar told Hephernaan of her troubles. And when her tale was told, he said, "The people of the land long for righteousness. The gods have blessed you with a vision. You know what you must do.”

And Caelar did.

(Scrawled notation: We know too little about this Hephernaan. Caelar relies fully on him, but does he serve her interests or his own? When I return to Berdusk, I’ll see what information I can dig up.)

Our Glorious Purpose
Together, Caelar and Hephernaan called out to the people of Faerûn. From the coasts and the plains, the mountains and the deserts, men and women of courage and righteous conviction answered Caelar’s call, flocking to the Shining Lady’s banner.

The fulfillment of Caelar’s vision is at hand. Goodness and justice will prevail—with your help. Together, we will free the unjustly damned and smite the evil that dares lay claim on mortal souls. An age of light is about to break through the darkness. Will you be a part of it?

(Scrawled notation: This crusade may be more dangerous than we initially thought. We have agents near Baldur’s Gate; I’ll ask them to investigate the crusader camp near Bridgefort. Perhaps we can head Caelar off before she does too much damage.)</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>(This thick sheet of parchment is rolled tightly and tied with a bit of patterned ribbon.)

However, en route to their den, the kobolds surprised a family of stone giants. These giants rescued Stewart and raised him as their own. It soon became apparent that the boy, no matter how hard he tried, could not compete in the family rock-throwing contests. The stone giant father bartered with a local wizard for this girdle, which made Stewart as strong as his brothers and sisters. When Stewart met an untimely end, the girdle was stolen away.

Driven by paranoia and mistrust, Narbucchad successively eliminated his guard in fear of attempts at assassination , and channeled all of his magic into a weapon after his own that could strike down any foe or number of would-be assailants at a time. Originally devised for such dire circumstances only, he quickly grew fond of its potential to cut all sorts of quarrels short and before long came to rely upon it wholly.

However, the staff required frequent recharging as its enchantments, albeit powerful, would quickly drain in frequent use and spring the orb of power from its socket, requiring careful reinsertion. Many stories circulated of those who had survived and escaped by whim of his Fickle Finger and thus known, it happened to fail him at rather a crucial moment before long.

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None 

A Dispel Magic spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Dispel Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with one difference: There is no Saving Throw bonus. Dire Charm affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Dire Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>Dire Charm

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>.

If you are reading this, it means I have met an untimely death. I would tell you not to grieve for me, but I feel much better thinking that you would. There are things I must tell you in this letter that I might have told you before. However, if my death came too soon, then I would have never been given the chance. First off, I am not your biological father, for that distinction lies with an entity known as Bhaal. The Bhaal that I speak of is the one you know of as a divinity. In the crisis known as the Time of Troubles, when the gods walked Faerûn, Bhaal was also forced into a mortal shell. He was somehow forewarned of the death that awaited him during this time. For reasons unknown to me, he sought out women of every race and forced himself upon them. Your mother was one of those women, and as you know, she died in childbirth. I had been her friend and, on occasion, lover. I felt obligated to raise you as my own. I have always thought of you as my child, and I hope you still think of me as your father. You are a special child. The blood of the gods runs through your veins.

Gorion</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>[Gorion's Note]Hello, <CHARNAME>,
If you are reading this, it means I have met an untimely death. I would tell you not to grieve for me, but I feel much better thinking that you would. There are things I must tell you in this letter that I might have told you before. However, if my death came too soon, then I would have never been given the chance. First off, I am not your biological father, for that distinction lies with an entity known as Bhaal. The Bhaal that I speak of is the one you know of as a divinity. In the crisis known as the Time of Troubles, when the gods walked Faerûn, Bhaal was also forced into a mortal shell. He was somehow forewarned of the death that awaited him during this time. For reasons unknown to me, he sought out women of every race and forced himself upon them. Your mother was one of those women, and as you know, she died in childbirth. I had been her friend and, on occasion, lover. I felt obligated to raise you as my own. I have always thought of you as my child, and I hope you still think of me as your father.

As you have probably heard, the iron poison has begun to take effect around the coast. With the majority of iron imports being disrupted by Tazok, almost all of it comes from the tainted source in Nashkel. The Sythillisian uprising in Amn has ensured that no forces from that nation will be able to take action against our mercenary forces. However, the Flaming Fist has caught several of the Blacktalon mercenaries. All of those captured have claimed allegiance with the Zhentarim and have thus shifted any suspicion away from the Iron Throne. I have sent Tranzig to work with the mercenaries in transporting the iron to your base in Cloakwood.

As we both know, forecasting these events has proved increasingly difficult, leaving little option other than a leap of faith. We have done what we can for those in thy care, but the time nears when we must step back and let matters take what course they will. We have, perhaps, been a touch too sheltering to this point. 

Despite my desire to remain neutral in this matter, I could not, in good conscience, let events proceed without some measure of warning. The other side will move very soon, and I urge thee to leave Candlekeep this very night, if possible. The darkness may seem equally threatening, but a moving target is much harder to hit, regardless of how sparse the cover. A fighting chance is all that can be asked for at this point.

Should anything go awry, do not hesitate to seek aid from travelers along the way. I do not need to remind thee that it is a dangerous land, even without our current concerns, and a party is stronger than an individual in all respects. Should additional assistance be required, I understand that Jaheira and Khalid are currently at the Friendly Arm Inn. They know little of what has passed, but they are ever thy friends and will no doubt help however they can.

Luck be with us all.

I'm getting too old for this.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

The Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against <PRO_HISHER> morals, except of course a Dispel Magic spell. The target gets a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty in order to avoid the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails his Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken.

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails his Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he is charmed.

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Mage has 12 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 9 Hit Points, so the caster gets a bonus of 4 Hit Points. The caster now has 16 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the caster loses those 4 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 12), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 9 damage.

Upon casting this spell the wizard conjurs several spider eggs into existence, quickly producing fully grown spiders that remain under the wizard's telepathic control. The type of spiders that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.
 7th: Giant spider.
 9th: Phase spider.
 12th+: Sword spider.
There is a 20% chance that two spiders of the proper type will appear instead of just one. These spider(s) will remain under the wizard's control until slain or the spell duration expires.

Saving Throw: None

A wizard who casts a Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental spell summons an earth elemental to do <PRO_HISHER> bidding. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell's duration expires, or the elemental dies. However, every time this spell is cast, there is a 15% chance that the elemental will escape the instructions of the caster, go berserk, and attack the wizard who dared summoning it. If it can't reach the summoner, it will fight its way toward <PRO_HIMHER>. This berserking elemental will also remain until slain or the spell's duration expires. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. At the end of this time, if the caster has won, <PRO_HESHE> has control of the elemental; however, if <PRO_HESHE> has lost, the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill <PRO_HIMHER>. This does not prevent the use of other charm-type spells after the contest was lost. If charm spells are used before the contest is over, they will have no effect on the outcome.

This spell is similar to the 7th-level Spell Turning, which causes the spells cast against the wizard to rebound upon the original caster. This affects a total of 4 spell levels. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard as well as area effects that are stationary such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be reflected back upon the caster. This spell will only affect up to 4th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining then the spell will be reflected. For example if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be reflected while canceling the spell turning.

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of <PRO_HISHER> repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed—up to 6th-level spells at 18th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster may choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon <PRO_HIMHER>. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.

One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed—up to 6th-level spells at 18th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster may choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon <PRO_HIMHER>. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.

A limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster: Therefore, it may not be an offensive spell, nor may it target any other party members.

Area of Effect: The caster

This powerful abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 10 spell levels. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard, as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be absorbed. Something to note is that as long as there are levels remaining, then the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the spell deflection. It is not affected by a Dispel Magic.</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>Spell Deflection

Upon casting a Conjure Fire Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster.

The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out.

However, every time this spell is cast, there is a 15% chance that the elemental will escape the instructions of the caster, go berserk, and attack the wizard who dared summoning it. If it can't reach the summoner, it will fight its way toward <PRO_HIMHER>. This berserking elemental will also remain until slain or the spell's duration expires. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned.

Second, the magic mutates the carrion crawlers into larger, more vicious versions of themselves. The wizard now has control over these creature(s) until they are slain or the spell's duration expires. There is a 35% chance that two carrion crawlers will be summoned instead of one.

By casting the Summon Nishruu spell, a wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power: the nishruu. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, this boiling, churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn toward magic like a moth to the flame, the nishruu feed on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature, and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. The nishruu have no physical attacks at all, although physical attacks can hurt them. Each time a nishruu touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around him, the wizard loses 1 random spell of the highest level currently memorized. The nishruu is completely immune to magic (except for Death Spell), and magic will actually heal it. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until slain or until the spell's duration expires.</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>Summon Nishruu

If the creature does not make a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature suffers a Saving Throw penalty of -1 every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead are completely unaffected.

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This is the combat version of Dispel Magic; it will only affect opponents. A Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>Remove Magic

Champion after champion has wielded this blade against countless enemies, and the blood it has spilled could fill a small sea. History will not admit that such a blade could be forged and each consecutive owner seems to tie its origin to whatever creation myth they believe. The most grandiose of these tales is that of a great chieftain who sailed to the cliffs that supposedly bordered the world. There he reached into the void, and his will shaped the blade from nothing. Whatever the truth, in the right hands this sword is a fearsome thing.

For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.
